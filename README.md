# Airbnb Clone
  This project is a simplified clone of Airbnb's website, built using React. The primary focus of the application is to showcase a list of hotels and allow users to filter them based on selected criteria. The project is structured to ensure scalability and maintainability, adhering to modern web development best practices.
  
## Components Overview
### Header
The Header component provides the top navigation bar, including the logo and links to other sections of the application. It ensures users have quick access to the main features of the site.

### Filter
The Filter component allows users to filter the list of hotel cards displayed. Filters could be based on attributes like price range, location, and amenities. This component uses the state to track the user's selection and dynamically updates the list of displayed hotels.

### Cards
The Cards component is responsible for displaying the list of hotels. Each hotel is displayed as a card, which includes an image, name, price, and a brief description. The data for these cards is sourced from card-list.js in the assets directory.

### Footer
The Footer component provides additional information and links at the bottom of the application. This could include links to social media, contact information, and other useful resources.

### Data Management
The hotel data is managed in a separate file, card-list.js, located in the src/assets/ directory. This allows for easy modification and expansion of the dataset without altering the core functionality of the app.

### Styling
The application is styled using CSS, with the primary styles located in App.css. The components are styled to ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
